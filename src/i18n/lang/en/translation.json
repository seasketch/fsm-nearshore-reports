Individuals identified the sectors they participate in, and were asked to draw the areas they use relative to that sector and assign a value of importance. Individual responses were then combined to produce aggregate heatmaps by sector. This allows the value of areas to be quantified, summed, and compared to one another as more or less valuable.</p><p>Value is then used as a proxy for measuring the potential economic loss to sectors caused by the creation of protected areas. This report can be used to minimize the potential impact of a plan on a sector, as well as identify and reduce conflict between conservation objectives and sector activities. The higher the proportion of value within the plan, the greater the potential impact to the fishery if access or activities are restricted.</p><p>Note, the resulting heatmaps are only representative of the individuals that were surveyed.</p><p>üéØ Planning Objective: there is no specific objective/target for limiting the potential impact of ocean use activities.</p><p>üó∫Ô∏è Methods:</p><5><0><0>Spatial Access Priority Mapping Overview</0></0></5><p>üìà Report: Percentages are calculated by summing the areas of value within the MPAs in this plan, and dividing it by all sector value.
