  "OUS Card - learn more": "<p>‚ÑπÔ∏è Overview: to capture the value each sector places on different areas of the nearshore, an Ocean Use Survey was conducted. Individuals identified the sectors they participate in, and were asked to draw the areas they use relative to that sector and assign a value of importance. Individual responses were then combined to produce aggregate heatmaps by sector. This allows the value of areas to be quantified, summed, and compared to one another as more or less valuable.</p><p>Value is then used as a proxy for measuring the potential economic loss to sectors caused by the creation of protected areas. This report can be used to minimize the potential impact of a plan on a sector, as well as identify and reduce conflict between conservation objectives and sector activities. The higher the proportion of value within the plan, the greater the potential impact to the fishery if access or activities are restricted.</p><p>Note, the resulting heatmaps are only representative of the individuals that were surveyed.</p><p>üéØ Planning Objective: there is no specific objective/target for limiting the potential impact of ocean use activities.</p><p>üó∫Ô∏è Methods:</p><5><0><0>Spatial Access Priority Mapping Overview</0></0></5><p>üìà Report: Percentages are calculated by summing the areas of value within the MPAs in this plan, and dividing it by all sector value.

Many will need regular, active interventions to meet the needs of particular species or habitats, but this is not a requirement of the category</p><p>IUCN V Protected landscape or seascape: Where the interaction of people and nature over time has produced a distinct character with significant ecological, biological, cultural and scenic value: and where safeguarding the integrity of this interaction is vital to protecting and sustaining the area and its associated nature conservation and other values</p><p>IUCN VI Protected areas with sustainable use of natural resources: Areas which conserve ecosystems, together with associated cultural values and traditional natural resource management systems. Generally large, mainly in a natural condition, with a proportion under sustainable natural resource management and where low-level non-industrial natural resource use compatible with nature conservation is seen as one of the main aims</p><p>IUCN Other Effective area-based Conservation Measures (OECM): A geographically defined area other than a Protected Area, which is governed and managed in ways that achieve positive and sustained long-term outcomes for the in situ conservation of biodiversity, with associated ecosystem functions and services and where apppcable, cultural, spiritual, socio¬ñeconomic, and other locally relevant values (CBD, 2018).</p><p>Locally Managed Marine Areas (LMMA)</p><p>IUCN Ia, Ib, II, and III are considered High Biodiversity Protection Zones (HBPZs).
