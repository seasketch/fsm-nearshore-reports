                      ‚ÑπÔ∏è Overview: to capture the value each sector places on
                      different areas of the nearshore, an Ocean Use Survey was
                      conducted. Individuals identified the sectors they
                      participate in, and were asked to draw the areas they use
                      relative to that sector and assign a value of importance.
                      Individual responses were then combined to produce
                      aggregate heatmaps by sector. This allows the value of
                      areas to be quantified, summed, and compared to one
                      another as more or less valuable.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Value is then used as a proxy for measuring the potential
                      economic loss to sectors caused by the creation of
                      protected areas. This report can be used to minimize the
                      potential impact of a plan on a sector, as well as
                      identify and reduce conflict between conservation
                      objectives and sector activities. The higher the
                      proportion of value within the plan, the greater the
                      potential impact to the fishery if access or activities
                      are restricted.
