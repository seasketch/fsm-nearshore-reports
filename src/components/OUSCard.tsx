                    ‚ÑπÔ∏è Overview: to capture the value each sector places on
                    different areas of the nearshore, an Ocean Use Survey was
                    conducted. Individuals identified the sectors they
                    participate in, and were asked to draw the areas they use
                    relative to that sector and assign a value of importance.
                    Individual responses were then combined to produce aggregate
                    heatmaps by sector. This allows the value of areas to be
                    quantified, summed, and compared to one another as more or
                    less valuable.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Value is then used as a proxy for measuring the potential
                    economic loss to sectors caused by the creation of protected
                    areas. This report can be used to minimize the potential
                    impact of a plan on a sector, as well as identify and reduce
                    conflict between conservation objectives and sector
                    activities. The higher the proportion of value within the
                    plan, the greater the potential impact to the fishery if
                    access or activities are restricted.

                  <p>
                    Note, the resulting heatmaps are only representative of the
                    individuals that were surveyed.
